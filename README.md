Things tend to make sense if you start at the beginning. After a more or less lifelong battle with substance abuse and just enough of an unfair edge college was actually over. 
Now what? How do I adult? TL;DR boy meets girl, have 5 fantastic years together, and the old deamons come back to nest. Only this time with grownup money.
I do believe a brand new Honda Civic went up my nose, in my arm or any other manner one can ingest something to make you not feel like you anymore. Thing is though...
After 4 years of no food or water... sleep... vitamin d... plus, y'know... dregs and alchyhol don't make a tiny mark, the grownups start noticing. And the grownup money disappears.
What. Do. We. Do. Now.
We sneak in a humblebrag is what we do, about 9/10 activities I participate in, whether it be physical, in school, at work I excell at immediately. For 25 years I took that for granted.
Now there was just enough of the grownup money left for a 6 month detox in Costa Rica, upon returning to Sweden we were homeless, broke and owed the government about 120000€.
We made do, I reschooled and became a chef with a more than fair living, she recovered too. More scars in her soul, something i try to remedy every day.
Then comes cancer. Breast and lymphoma. We moved 4 times during her chemo, driving licenses gone of course, because, well driving with 17 substances in your body is frowned upon up here.
Debt, no steady living situation, the so-called free healthcare, one income and one suffering wife who had to take the bus 40 minutes to and fro 3-4 doctors appointments a week.
What do I do now? No family on either side, live fast die young is apparently hereditary and the hours in the restaurant business aren't really legal.
Wigs need purchasing, debt needs paying, packing needs to be done. Again. All the while watching her skip yoghurt, you know, the one t´hing she could keep down. in her time of need because we messed up. Murphy.
Then along comes a friend, tells me about this thing called IDEX, and Bittrex. Two centralised exchanges back in the day. And it all just made sense.
Most of it was pure dumb luck.
Three weeks later our income was bolstered by 500€ a week. And it was all so simple! Wigs were purchased, a downpayment on a place without an expiration date just magically fell out of the sky.
All it took was spending all night trying to figure out the tools we take for granted today, every night. But she was comfortable, and everything was starting to look a little less
black day after day. We could date, we could be... Normal, all thanks to countless hours in front of a screen!
Arrogant and narcissistic as I was I immediately thought I had this figured out and should be teaching classes in how to to crypto.
Then came the first hack. I could not understand how it happened, I mean, I had a capital letter and a symbol in my password! And a google 2fa!
Then came the first smart conrtact.
Then the second hack. And the third. Then the full blown identity theft.
How? I was a pro dammit! With my 2fa and the same password, saved mind you, and the desperation began. I realise now that I was a bumbling blithering buffoon waaaaay out of my depth.
And still am. The difference now is that I know that a few old computers, an ellipal titan and a whole lot of humbling reading is the way forward. Because this thing is here to stay.
That brings me to my project. A now thoroughly shook, humbled and open minded individual wants to give the student a way of not drowning in debt. A way for the family to help pay off
their ridicculous mortgages and the down and out a way back in. Just... maybe not the route I took. Maybe a sustainable, easy, all in one place step by step. For cheap.
Not the get rich quick kids with a trust fund they make one lucky buy in before Lord Elon opened his mouth and they made a killing over a weekend.
Those that want to put in the work, do it themselves with realistic hopes. That word is key here. This is not a how to get rich for dummies, but a guide on how not to be like yours truly.
It starts with me and my own project, I wrote my first line of code 2 weeks ago. My strength lies in my ability to make anybody understand anything. And what's out there today
